Other points of departure (including
a NOAEL) were higher than the LOAEL
identified by Gilman et al. (1998) and
therefore HC (2019c) did not consider
an uncertainty factor for use of a LOAEL
instead of a NOAEL necessary. HC
(2019c) did not apply an uncertainty
factor for use of a subchronic study
because the study was considered
adequately sensitive since the observed
kidney effects were similar to the minimal
effects seen in a number of longer-term
studies and since human absorption
values were found to be independent
of exposure duration (HC, 2019c).","LOAEL =
