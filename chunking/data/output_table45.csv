Duration: up to 13 weeks
Uncertainty Factors: 25 (10 for
intraspecies variability and 2.5 for
the toxicodynamic component of the
default interspecies uncertainty factor).
No uncertainty factor was used for
subchronic-to-chronic extrapolation,
as liver effects were investigated in a
chronic study (Butenhoff et al., 2012)
and increasing duration of exposure
did not appear to worsen the effects
in the key study (Perkins et al., 2004).","BMDL =
